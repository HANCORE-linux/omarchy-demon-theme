# Demon
Born from the idea of inner power restrained by control — deep blacks and crimson accents evoke the calm before chaos.
This theme captures the duality of the demon: precision within darkness, strength within silence.
Created to embody intensity and focus — a workspace that feels alive, yet disciplined.
